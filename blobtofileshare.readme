To move files from Azure Blob Storage to an Azure File Share without relying on local storage, we can:

Use Azure Blob Storage SDK or APIs to download the blobs directly to an Azure File Share without staging the files on a local disk.

Copy the blobs directly from Blob Storage to the File Share.

Updated Steps
Use Azure Storage Client to interact directly with both Blob Storage and Azure File Shares.

Mount the File Share using SMB: You can still use the New-PSDrive method to map the Azure File Share to the runbook session, but we won’t use the local filesystem to store the files in between.

Updated Runbook Example
Here's how you can update the runbook to directly copy files from Blob Storage to an Azure File Share in the cloud:

Authenticate to Azure (same as before).

Mount Azure File Share: You can still mount the Azure File Share using a domain account, but since there’s no C: drive, we’ll make the operation cloud-based.

Key Points:
Get-AzStorageBlobContent: The cmdlet Get-AzStorageBlobContent can be used to download the blobs directly to the mapped Azure File Share without needing a local path.

No Local Disk: This updated approach avoids any dependency on a local disk (like C:) by directly moving files between Azure services (Blob Storage and File Share).

Summary:
You authenticate with Azure using a service principal or managed identity.

You map the Azure File Share using the New-PSDrive cmdlet (with domain credentials).

You then directly copy the files from the Azure Blob Storage to the File Share using the Get-AzStorageBlobContent cmdlet.

The runbook executes all tasks directly within Azure, so no local disk is required.

Error Handling & Logging (Optional):
You might want to add error handling and logging to make sure the process is smooth and easy to debug. Here’s an example of how you could add logging:

try {
    # Your file copy logic here
    $blob | Get-AzStorageBlobContent -Destination $fileSharePath -Context $blobServiceClient.Context
    Write-Output "Successfully moved $blobName to the file share"
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to move $blobName: $_"
}
